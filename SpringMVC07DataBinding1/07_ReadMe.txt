00. This project is based on gontu series video 13
01. In the earlier examples, we have seen user submitted fields "Name" and "Hobby" bind to String variables like 
"studentName" and "studentHobby"
02. In this tutorial, we will see binding using different data types like Date, Collection(ArrayList), long, etc..
03. Since we are using @ModelAttribute, these bindings will be pretty seemless.
04. Note that when you enter date of birth, use the format as MM/DD/YYYY. If you use, MM-DD-YYYY then server will give error.
