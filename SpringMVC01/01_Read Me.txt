01. In eclipse, create dynamic web project
02. Give name to Project : SpringMVC01
03. In order to use Spring Framework, we need to download spring jars from the the following location:
	http://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring/
04. In order to manage dependencies, you can take a look at maven or gradle in following link:
	http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/
05. Copy all the spring jars and paste them in to the Projects lib folder i.e. Project>WebContent>WEB-INF>lib 
06. Spring also needs commons-logging jars for logging purposes, which can be downloaded here: 
	http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/download_logging.cgi
07. Now we need any web server that supports servlet JSP technology like Apache Tomcat, Websphere, Weblogic, Jboss, etc..
08. We will be using apache tomcat server.
09. Download and installation instructions are given here:
	http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
10. In order to integrate web server with eclipse, go to Eclipse > Window > Show View > Other > Servers > Servers. 
11. This will open servers view, so select "new server wizard". So, we will be selecting Apache > Tomcat v7.0 Server. Click Next...
12. Provide Tomcat installation directory which was downloaded above. Click Finish...
13. In eclipse, right click on project > Targeted Runtimes > Check on Apache tomcat v7.0. Click Finish...

14. Then we updated web.xml to include spring framework.
15. Then We added spring-dispatcher-servlet.xml. This is called FRONT CONTROLLER in Spring Framework

16. Add HelloController.java file and HelloPage.jsp files.
17. Now we are ready to run application on server, for this, right click on project and Run As > Chose Run on Server
18. Then open any browser and go to url: http://localhost:8080/SpringMVC01/welcome.html
	The browser should display the appropriate message
