01. This project is based on Gontu Series video 38. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to support xml format for our project. We only need to add jars and no code change is required.
02. Download "jackson dataformat xml" jar (from Web URL: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat/jackson-dataformat-xml). Which version to download depends on which Spring version I have. The jackson jars("jackson-core", "jackson-annotations", "jackson-databind") that I am using for json support is of version 2.8.1 (from previous tutorials) so I have downloaded jackson-dataformat-xml-2.8.1 for xml support. Along with this jar, also download its corresponding dependencies ("jackson-module-jaxb-annotations", "woodstox-core" and "stax-2-api" jars) from the same web page.
03. When a REST API Controller method supports more than one format (json and xml) then it is Client's responsibility to specify along with the request in what format it wants to view the response. 
04. Test it out on Postman. It should return response in xml format when Accept header = application/xml and it should return json response when Accept header = application/json.
